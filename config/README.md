* attendance bound
  ** Chicago open data portal: School Attendance Boundary 

* tract-tier-table
  ** links usually maintained at http://cpstiers.opencityapps.org/tier-calculation.html
    *** otherwise google fu may be necessary
  ** recommend use of tabula to convert to csv, then open in excel and manually clean
    data

* cutoff scores
  ** check for .pdfs of cutoff scores at https://go.cps.edu/learn/resources
  ** I've been manually entering these

* program data
  ** need list of school ids with school lat/longs -- easiest way to get these is
    using Chicago Open Data portal school locations dataset. Scraper expects a .csv
    in this format.
