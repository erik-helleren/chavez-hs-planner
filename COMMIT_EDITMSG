Finish cutoff score config scripts

* NOTE had left the cutoff score part of the config system unfinished
as I started testing; previously the config build scripts had just
copied the cutoff score config to the output data folder.

* split cutoff scores into two separate config files -- one for
  selective enrollment (tier-based) cutoff scores and another for
  non-selective enrollment (tier-irrelevant) cutoff scores.
  ** update schema.
* remove unecessary 'date' property from cutoff scores config and
  cutoff scores config schema
* write config build script that converts cutoff score config to
  two tables -- one relating non-selective program ids to cutoff scores,
  the other relating selective enrollment program ids to cutoff scores.

* fill in missing program ids in cutoff scores config
  ** add any new program types found from programs in cutoff scores
  config to program type ids config.
    *** NOTE this situation is caused by having more recent cutoff scores than
    program data. We're still waiting on new program data from CPS, but
    we have the most recent cutoff scores, making life interesting.
