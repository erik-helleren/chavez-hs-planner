List missing req fns at runtime

* NOTE originally tried listing req fns using a npm script or
  something in that vein, but compiling req fns separately from
  the whole app was super complex. Decided to keep it simple,
  if less elegant, and put the missing requirement function
  check in the application logic, in the reducer util that creates
  Program elements.
