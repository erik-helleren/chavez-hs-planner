Config: Add json schema validation for outputted data

* NOTE previously only inputted data was validated by json schema.
  Now, the outputted data produced by the build scripts is validated
  before it is written to the output folder.

* TODO IN FUTURE consider separating the data manipulation and
  validation code in the build scripts; currently it happens in the same
  place, which is making it harder to see what the code is doing at a
  glance.
