Fix another logic error in CTE selection function

* NOTE debug notes:
  ** behavior: functions were always outputting 'LIKELY', as though
    the student had passed requirements, even when student hadn't.
  ** cause: requirement function filter higher order functions were not being
    called when included in if-statements, but the functions themselves
    were truthy, so if-statements always succeeded.
    *** e.g: it was:              
        'if ( ifHasGrades({nweaMath: 40}) ) {`
    *** it should have been:  
        'if ( ifHasGrades({nweaMath: 40})(student, program) ) {

* NOTE the requirement function filters tripped me up -- another good example
  of benefits of keeping things simple instead of clever. (I think the
  performance/speed benefits of the new clever requirement functions
  still outweigh the negatives, though.)
