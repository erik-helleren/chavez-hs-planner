[WIP] Unify CPSProgram and HSProgram types into Program

* DONE remove unused types CPSPrograms
* DONE rename CPSProgram -> CPSProgramRawData
* DONE rename HSRequirementFunction -> ProgramRequirementFunction

* DONE remove state.hsData.outcomes - calculate these in components
* DONE store programs in redux store as Program

* DONE convert CPSProgramRawData to Program in shared/util/data-access
* DONE remove most methods from shared/util/data-access
* DONE move shared/util/is-es-program and is-hs-program to data-access

* DONE change function signature of program requirement functions
* DONE add ProgramOutcome data type
* DONE add programOutcomes property to redux state
  ** TODO write code that updates programOutcomes on student data change

* TODO remove immutablejs dependency

* TODO refactor app to work with data changes
  ** TODO change app to separate programs and outcomes
  ** TODO change all references to CPS and HS Programs to Program
  ** TODO refactor app's components into presentational and containers
    to minimize impact of data changes like this in the future.
