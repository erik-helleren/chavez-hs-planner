Config: debug issue in school attendance boundaries

* NOTE - bug log
  ** observed: school attendance boundaries output json file had no
  coordinates, only school ids. Unknown whether all school ids are
  present.
  ** tested: added console log statements to
  create-school-attendance-boundaries.js to see where coordinates
  were getting lost. Tracked it to the mapping function that rounded
  the coordinates to decimal precision.
    *** Discovered here that default Math.round implementation does
    not round to decimal places -- it rounds to number of digits. In
    addition, it apparently is a source of floating point math errors.
    Note to self, don't use Math.round for this kind of thing in the
    future!
  ** changed: copied and pasted in an accurate round() function from the
    mozilla developer article about issues with Math.round, and used
    that instead.
  ** observed: coordinates now appear in output file. They look ok to
  the eye, but I do not know if they are accurate, or if all school IDs
  are present in the file.
