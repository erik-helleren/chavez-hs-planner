Implement accurate inAttendBound function

* add sy1718 attend bound geojson to config/data
* write a script in config/build to convert geojson
  data to json object of geometries keyed by school id
* add geojson-precision npm dep to devDependencies
* reduce resolution of school geometries file using
  geojson-precision
* copy reduced resolution school geometries to src/shared/data
* write an implementation of point-in-polygon in shared/util
* write inAttendBound function

* NOTE many schools whose requirements say that the student
  must live within attendance boundaries do not have attendance
  boundaries
  ** also, two of the school IDs that are missing and SHOULD have
    attendance boundaries are numbers that show up repeated many,
    many times in the fractional parts of the latlong for school
    attendance bounds. What the hell?
  ** IMPORTANT it looks like a 'proximity' lottery is different from
    a 'in attendance bound' lottery. wwhhhhhaaw that's important.

* TODO IN FUTURE memoize inAttendBound function
