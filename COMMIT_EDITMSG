DRAFT Add RIT input to NWEA score fields

* Add student grade field to student data form  -- we need
  to know student's grade to give meaningful rit scores.
* Change initial app state to set nwea percentiles as null
* Change code that operate on app nwea percentile to gracefully
  handle null values
* Change initial app state to set grade level as null
* Change code that operates on grade level to gracefully handle
  null values
* Fix bug in which grade level was stored as string by reducer
* Remove behavior in NumberField in which state was not updated
  if field's value was empty string

* TODO IN FUTURE confusing behavior resulting from lack of synchrony
  between fields.
