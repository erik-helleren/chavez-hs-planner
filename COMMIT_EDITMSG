Move cutoff scores to config/data

* DONE come up with a consistent schema for cutoff scores.
  ** NOTE the most consistent thing may be to separate SE
  cutoff scores from non-SE cutoff scores, under the assumption
  that no other school will do the tier thing.
* add historical cutoff scores json to config/data
* add historical cutoff scores json schema to config/schema
* write cutoff scores processing script
  ** validate schema in processing script

* NOTE IMPORTANT cutoff scores are NOT currently linked to
  programs via program IDs. 
  ** The reason is that I'm considering a change to the program ID 
  approach that will be less likely to change over time. Currently, 
  programIDs are created by hashing two properties of the raw program 
  data -- the school name and the program type. This means that small
  changes in the formatting of school names and program types 
  (like capitalization changes, etc) result in completely different
  programIDs, even though they're describing the 'same' program.
  ** What I'm considering instead is to make the programID of the 
  form <schoolID>-<programTypeID>, where schoolID is the standard
  CPS school ID and programTypeID is an ID the app comes up with by
  normalizing program types.
