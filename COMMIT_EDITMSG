Update student data form to work with changes to config system and store

* NOTE there were many compiation errors that were fixed, relating to
  import paths etc
* NOTE changes made after enabling 'strictNullChecks' in typescript
compiler.

* update student data form redux-aware components to interface with the new and
  improved store
  ** NOTE deleting all of that crufty immutablejs and data mangling
  logic in the selectors feels good

* minor refactor in naming conventions and style for student data form
  field components

* fix bug in shared form field component DropdownField -- did not
specify nullable value in props interface

* DONE remove MultiSelectField from student data form
  ** NOTE due to tight coupling between the way I designed the
  multiselect field and the app's data, it caused a lot of data
  munging, before and after the refactor that I attempted. I could
  either fully rewrite it ('better this time!') or push it out of the
  way and replace it (and hopefully all the other fields) with a form
  field libarary.
  ** NOTE TO SELF These leaky abstractions I've created in the name of 'efficiency'
  are hindrances. I need to be more careful about my instinct to
  hand-roll my own solutions rather than use libraries; frequently my
  hand rolled code is too clever and brittle to keep up with my changes.
