[WIP] Make program IDs stable

* NOTE programIDs now use a combination of the stable school ID
  and a new, stable program type ID. The program type ID is configured
  by a new data dependency, program-types.json. This commit adds a system
  for building program-types.json and using program-types.json to create
  stable program IDs.

* NOTE cutoff scores and requirement function constansts, and anywhere
  else the old unstable programIDs have been used, have not been updated
  with the new stable programIDs.

* DONE add program-types.json to config/data
  ** DONE filled in with programs according to September 2017 data
* DONE add program-types json schema to config/schema
* DONE write new build_scripts util getProgramTypeID(programType)
* TODO change build-scripts/util/normalize-program-data to create
  stable program ID from school ID and program type ID.
  ** TODO have normalize-program-data throw if program type not found
  in program-types.json.
