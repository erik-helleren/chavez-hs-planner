[WIP] Fix errors in build scripts

* TODO need to fix a basic assumption in the program type ID config
code. The basic assumption is that all programs being passed to it are
high school programs ... in fact, the programs being passed are all CPS
programs, ES, HS, and Middle school. And separating out which programs
are which is not easy with the current data set. Need to think about
when to separate programs into hs and es.

* NOTE wide-ranging changes, see diff for details
* NOTE funniest mistake: I had been trying to use an npm package called
  2json2csv to convert csv to json
