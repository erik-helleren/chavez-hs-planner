Fix errors in build scripts

* separate processed program data into hs programs and non-hs
  programs, in separate json files.
  ** Change the way program IDs are created for non hs programs. For hs
  programs, program IDs are made from combining school ID and program
  type ID; for non HS programs, because we do not have a normalized
  table of non hs progam types to get IDs from, I just used the plain
  text of the progam type.
    *** NOTE this may cause problems down the line with parsing the
    school id from the program id. I don't think those potential
    problems are worth architecture astronauting a better solution right
    now.
* TODO IN FUTURE consider reducing the amount of data in the non hs
  progams json -- we only end up using the id, school name, program
  name, and location, I'm pretty sure.

* NOTE wide-ranging changes, see diff for details
* NOTE funniest mistake: I had been trying to use an npm package called
  json2csv to convert csv to json
