Refactor app to adjust to changes in redux store

* TODO refactor redux-aware components to connect to new store
* TODO move selected hs program id into ProgramList internal state

* refactor all code which previously interaced with data-access
  to instead load data dynamically from redux store.
* remove some data verification code in requirement functions that
  threw on receiving uninitialized data; because the app loads
  data dynamically on startup, refactored requirement functions to
  instead gracefully handle uninitialized data.
