Replace current grade dropdown with skipped 7th grade dropdown

* DONE rename currGradeField -> skippedGradeField
* DONE refactor reducer logic to convert 'skipped 7th grade or
  repeated 8th grade' answer to currGrade / prevGrade numbers
  ** if 'no', currGrade is 8, prevGrade is 7
  ** if 'yes', currGrade is 8, prevGrade is 8
