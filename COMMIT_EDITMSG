Support multiple word search queries

* NOTE previous behavior -- single word searches work,
  multiple word searches do not. This is caused by search
  suggestion algorithm splitting up search strings into words
  before matching them.

* Change search suggestion algorithm to check for matches at
  beginning of word boundaries
