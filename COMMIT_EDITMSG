[WIP] Fix wide-ranging errors in app data loading

* Fix error in loadAllData in which data action creators were not being
  dispatched.
* Fix error in data action creators not returning promises, resulting
  in loadAllData Promise.all() not working correctly.
* Fix error in reducer util createProgramGroupsDictionary 
* Fix error in programs being loaded into store as arrays of programs and
  not program dictionaries
* Fix error in createHSProgramDictionary / createNonHSProgramDictionary
  reducer utils in which original input was returned instead of
  processed output
* Fix error in HSProgramsContainer and HSGroup in which HSGroup's props
  said it wanted a Program[] but HSGroup's implementation actually
  wanted a ProgramDict. Changed mapStateToProps implementation in
  HSProgramsContainer to account for this.
* Fix error in which app expected shared/requirement functions to export
  bare requirement functions, when it actually exported all req function
  data.
* Fix error in HSGroup in which code did not gracefully handle
  uninitialized program outcomes
  ** change type def of ProgramOutcomeDictionary to include 'undefined'
  as a possible value for any key, so that the ts compiler cna force me
  to check for it.
* Fix error in which data loading reducers do not instantiate
  program outcomes
* Rewrite rootReducer to update outcomes after receiving
  student data
  ** Remove combineReducers implementation of rootReducer
  ** TODO Make sure we understand combineReducers before we swap it out
* Fix error in which ibPointSystem and sePointSystem requirement
  function builders were looking up cutoff scores by school ID rather than
  by progam ID.

* IMPORTANT manually added requirement functions for
