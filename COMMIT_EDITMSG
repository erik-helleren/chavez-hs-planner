Rewrite redux code to load and store all app data at initialization

* NOTE I didn't think through the way I had loaded the data earlier --
  I was trying to create the redux initial state using callbacks from
  the data-access promises. I realized that the better way to do things
  is to load all data into redux store after the app and redux store
  initialize themselves.

* move shared/util/data-access to shared/redux/data-access
* move cutoff scores, tract tier table, and school attendance 
  boundary table into redux store
* change redux initial state to have no externally loaded data
* add loadingData property to redux state
* add new actions and action creators to handle
  ** use redux-thunk to dispatch http requests in action creators
    to load data over the network

* rewrite reducers to handle loading app data
* when redux initializes, dispatch an action to get app data
  using code formerly in data-access method

* TODO IN FUTURE refactor code that accesses data-access - load data from redux
  store instead.
