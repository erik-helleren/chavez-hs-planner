Fix ComboBox dropdown styling

* NOTE ComboBox dropdown element appeared on top of input element
  -- this was caused by hard-coded offset from top/left of input
  element, which wasn't updated to keep up with input element. (hiss)

* Wrap ComboBox input in a div, and wrap ComboBox dropdown in another
  div, so that dropdown always appears directly below ComboBox input
