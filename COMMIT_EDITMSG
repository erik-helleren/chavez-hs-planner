Remove program type IDs, extra folders from config data

* NOTE Having to work with program type ID system again when updating
  data, I decided that it was too complex and failure-prone for the
  limited benefit (correcting the spellings of program types),
  especially if we're going to be grouping the programs by school in the
  future.

* Added a spelling correcter to build-program-data build script
