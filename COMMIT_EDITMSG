Fix bugs in hs req builders and hs req builders spec

spec errors
* add typescript type assertions to mock objects in testing code
  to prevent typescript compilation errors
* use lambda functions when calling expect(fn).to.throw()
* change ifInAttendBound spec to throw on failed attend bound lookup
* fix boolean error in ifStudentAttendsOneOf spec

code errors
* fix ifHasGrades returning true with NaN grades
  ** had used locally defined (and incorrect) uninitialized checker 
    instead of importing isUninitialized shared/util method
* check ifHasGrades target grades properties for validity
* fix ifInAttendBound latitude / longitude incorrect order
* fix lack of null checking in isUninitialized 
* fix shortsighted use of global isNaN in isUninitialized, which
  was causing unexpected values to return 'true' as uninitialized
  due to number type coercion. Replaced with Number.isNaN
* ifInAttendBound throws on failed attend bound lookup
* ifSiblingAttends - handle uninitialized studentData properties
* ifStudentAttendsOneOf throws on no programIDs passed to higher
  order function that creates filter
