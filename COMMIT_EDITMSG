Only check for missing/unused req fns in development

* NOTE whenever I touch webpack it's like a witch's curse that
  steals 2hrs of my time digging through stackoverflow.
  ** For some reason, webpack's DefinePlugin wasn't replacing
  compile-time constants like it should have been. I still have no
  idea why, but I was able to get around it by using the (undocumented?)
  --define flag to do the compile time replacement in the npm script.
