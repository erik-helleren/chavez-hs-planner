[WIP] Update app to work with changes to config system and store

* NOTE there were many compiation errors that were fixed, relating to
  import paths etc
* NOTE changes made after enabling 'strictNullChecks' in typescript
compiler.

* WIP update redux-aware components to interface with the new and
  improved store
  ** NOTE deleting all of that crufty immutablejs and data mangling
  logic in the selectors feels good
