Refactor app to use school id for sibling attendance

* NOTE previously app used program id for sibling attendance -- this is
  inaccurate.
* rename siblingHSProgramIDs -> siblingHSSchoolIDs
* add string -> string map of SchoolID -> SchoolName to app state
* write HS Schools map creating function in reducer-utils 
* write HS Schools selector in sibling-hs-progams field
