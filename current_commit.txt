Debug app afte changes in requirement functions

* fix tsc compilation errors
  ** add missing properties to hardcoded student data 
      in src/path-to-hs/hardcoded.ts
  ** update StudentData type to make seTestPercentile to make
    seTestPercentile property optional

* TODO remove requirement functions for Academic Centers in
  shared/data/hs_req_fns.ts
  ** NOTE earlier, I had incorrectly assumed Academic Centers
    were Selective Enrollment schools -- so I tried to look up
    their cutoff scores using the getSECutoff() function. This
    errored because Academic Centers are not SE schools.
