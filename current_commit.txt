[WIP] Add ReportCardContainer component

* ReportCardContainer contains ReportCard and effort
  amount adjuster. Purpose of ReportCardContainer is to abstract
  effort amount adjuster away from StudentDataDisplay, so that
  ReportCardContainer can be treated as a StudentData -> StudentData
  transformer.
* handle score adjustments and update parent with new StudentData
  via onChange callback

* update StudentData type
  ** make all properties non-optional
  ** add studentFirstName and studentLastName properties

* new component EffortLevelSelector, acts as display for current
  effort level and as selector for different effort level

* move EffortLevel and ScoreChange handling functions out of StudentInfoDisplay
  and into ReportCardContainer
