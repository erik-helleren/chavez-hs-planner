[WIP] Refactor app, implement redux

* DONE flatten StudentData.scores into StudentData
* DONE remove unused score-projection-utils
* DONE refactor StudentDataForm to expose onChange
    handlers for each field independently
* DONE make PathToHS stateless functional component
* TODO make StudentInfoDisplay and HSDisplay react aware
  ** prediction: if I did things right for the rest of development,
    I shoudn't need to refactor any of the child components
    for this to work. I should be able to cut the head off the state
    tree and replace it with redux, without cutting off the flow
    of state to any of the roots. (I got I think 4? hours of sleep last
    night? This is going to be a long day.)
* TODO simplify component tree of HSDisplay
  ** combine HSProgramType and HSList into HSList
  ** make HSDisplay true container for HSList
* DONE remove hardcoded default student data
* DONE draft redux actions in shared/actions
* TODO draft redux reducers in shared/reducers

* DONE move StudentDataForm child components up into src/components/
    student-info-display
* DONE move spinning-load-icon.scss into shared/styles
*
