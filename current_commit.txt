Add current elementary school progam to StudentData

* add currESProgram property to StudentData
* TODO IN FUTURE write requirement functions that rely on
  enrollment in certain elementary school programs
* TODO IN FUTURE write req functions that rely on 
  living in attend bounds of certain elementary schools
  ** NOTE both of the above will be time-consuming to write
    due to need to look up and copy school ids in requirement
    functions. So for the moment I'm shelving them in order to
    do more pressing work cleaning up the frontend of the app
    in order to present it in about a week.
