Update req fn outcomes and student gpa on state changes

* write updateDependentProperties function in
  shared/reducers/index.ts -- updates state based
  on independent properties that have changed, using
  new scores to update GPA, etc
* change implementation of calculateGPA to take
  array of scores rather than object
* write selectProgram in shared/util
* update AppState type to accurately reflect that
  state is nested immutableJS objects, not just an
  immutableJS map over plain old javascript objects
