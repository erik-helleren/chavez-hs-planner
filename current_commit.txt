Sort HSListElements by success chance

* simple/naive implentation in HSList, just
  involves running a sort operation on list
  of highschools passed to component. Sort
  operation runs all requirement functions,
  meaning each requirement function is called
  twice with same StudentData; there's gotta be
  a way to make that faster

* add Application_Requirements_Fn and
  Program_Selections_Fn to CPSProgram type,
  which somehow had been missing it
