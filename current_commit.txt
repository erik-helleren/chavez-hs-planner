Minor refactor and style ReportCard

* (rough) imitate actual report card as much as possible
* add StudentName prop
* remove 'editable' prop from ReportCard, will put it back
  if needed. I think I'm learning a lot about when abstraction
  is necessary and when it isn't. I'm trying to work from concrete
  needs first and abstract them later if necessary, rather than
  trying to nail the abstraction the first time. Which, when I
  say it like that, sounds like how abstraction is probably
  meant to work in the first place.
