[WIP] Refactor app, implement redux

* DONE sort hs elements, once, in redux
  ** this is triggering useless re-sorts on 
    props change -- maybe the diff isn't so good?
  ** plan: write the reducers first, then see if
    you're still having that problem. Good opportunity
    to find out what's going on.
* TODO IN FUTURE include immutablejs

* DONE write redux reducers in shared/reducers
  ** TODO IN FUTURE they are gross. ImmutableJS?
* TODO IN FUTURE split large reducers file into smaller
  pieces

* DONE import hs data in StudentDataForm
  (rather than loading it thru data-access)
* DONE connect HSDisplay to redux store
* DONE drastically refactor component tree of HSDisplay
  ** renamed HSDisplay -> HSProgramsContainer
* DONE move app data (hs lists, hs req fns) to redux
  ** DONE import hs req fns into redux
  ** DONE import hs outcomes into redux
    *** DONE write helper methods for calculating
      hs outcomes with studentData
  ** DONE write helper functions for updating
  ** DONE import hs lists into redux
  ** DONE build index of hs categories
* DONE flatten StudentData.scores into StudentData
* DONE remove unused score-projection-utils
* DONE refactor StudentDataForm to expose onChange
    handlers for each field independently
* DONE make PathToHS stateless functional component
* DONE replace StudentInfoDisplay with StudentDataContainer,
    move wrapper Box element in StudentInfoDisplay into
    PathToHS component
* DONE connect StudentDataContainer to redux store
* DONE remove hardcoded default student data
* DONE write redux actions in shared/actions

* DONE move StudentDataForm child components up into src/components/
    student-info-display
* DONE move spinning-load-icon.scss into shared/styles
* DONE remove unused old form field components
