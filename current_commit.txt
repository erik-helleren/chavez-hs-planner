Replace EffortLevelSelector with GradeChangeSelector

* rename EffortLevelSelector -> GradeChangeSelector,
 rewrite component to take in percentileChange: number
  and return a new percentile change: number.
* remove effort level-related code in ReportCardContainer
* remove EffortLevel enum from shared/enum

* NOTE: effort level was a little opaque to the user, not 
  to mention didn't solve the problem of converting back
  and forth from percentile change -> effort level.

* TODO IN FUTURE: convert positional arguments of functions
  in shared/util/grade-convert and shared/util/score-projection-utils
  into keyword arguments. (Just got bitten by inconsistent
  ordering of gradeLevel and percentileChange arguments
  between 'projectScores' and 'getAvgPercentileDifference'
  functions

* TODO IN FUTURE: a rounding error(?) in getAvgPercentileDifference
  causes average percentile difference to be different
  from the percentile difference of the individual scores
  somehow. IE, when the individual scores of a StudentData
  object are projected from 5th to 7th grade with 0 percentile
  difference, the output of getAvgPercentileDifference on 
  those two scores is 3.5.

  ** for the moment, I've just set the 'no change' value 
    in GradeChangeSelector to be active if percentileChange 
    is > -5 and < 5, but that's a very coarse fix.
