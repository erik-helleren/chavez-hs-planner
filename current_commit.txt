Add Program_ID property to HSProgram type

* Write create_program_id.py to add Program_ID property to
  hs_programs.json -- hash of school_ID and program type, so
  hopefully stable ID
* Add unique Program_ID to every highschool in hs_programs.json
* NOTE can now uniquely identify hs programs. This is not only handy
  in general but also important for e.g. identifying prev school
  that student attended, where sibling attended, or in which student's
  address must be w/in attend bounds
