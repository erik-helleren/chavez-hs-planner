Refactor HSInfoCard -- finish styling

* Clean up styling so it looks presentable
* add link to CPS Profile
* add link to HS Bound page
  ** TODO IN FUTURE -- move HS bound link generation
    somewhere else -- now it's called for each opening
    of HSInfoCard, which doesn't make sense. Also it's
    sometimes wrong in the case of acronyms
