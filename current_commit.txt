Fix HSInfoCard display bug

* style HSList to have position: absolute so that 
  HSInfoCard offset is computed relative to HSList -- 
  this prevents HSInfoCard from being displayed at 
  incorrect visual offset due to being offset relative
  to the outermost <body> element

* NOTE bug behavior: sometimes HSInfoCard appears far, far
  below the icon it's associated with.
  ** NOTE this is probably due to the height offset being
    calculated relative to a stationary component. When a
    HSProgram is off the screen, its offset relative to a
    stationary component may be -600px; When the HSProgram
    is scrolled up, the offset remains -600px
  ** NOTE another class of bugs likely caused by this approach
    -- on reflow on screen size change (unlikely to happen?) 
    the offsets are not recomputed
