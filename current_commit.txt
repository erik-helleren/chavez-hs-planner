[WIP] Draft ComboBoxField component

* DONE refactor ComboBoxField and DropdownField to 
  use data prop rather than props.children to
  pass choices

* DONE write basic ListBox component

* DONE style ComboBoxField components
  ** TODO write shared field style

* TODO get ComboBoxField component working
  with state updates etc
  ** I don't know if I'm tired or what but
    I'm really not making this work right now
  ** man I'm really feeling the pain of managing
    state by passing it up and down the component
    hierarchy. It makes changes very hard, and I
    keep accidentally creating infinite loops and
    hard-to-diagnose issues like this because I 
    don't keep the whole model in my head. 
    I think I really do need to switch to redux.
