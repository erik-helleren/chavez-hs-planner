Change how app handles Additional Requirements

* NOTE - additional requirements are the extra data
  outside of past school grades needed to decide 
  school admissions. Example additional requirements:
  Selective Enrollment admission test, IB school 
  information session, Fine arts school audition.

* DONE add AdditionalRequirements type to shared/types
* DONE add additionalRequirements property to StudentData
* DONE change type HSRequirementsFunction from 
  (StudentData, AdditionalReqs) => boolean to
  (StudentData) => boolean
* DONE refactor all implementations of HSRequirementsFunction
  in shared/data/hs-config-data, and handle case where
  AdditionalRequirement in AdditionalRequirements is null
* DONE refactor calculateSEPoints to remove additionalReqs
  positional argument, replaced by additionalRequirements property
  in StudentData
* TODO rename HSAdditionalRequirements -> AdditionalRequirementsDisplay
* TODO refactor AdditionalRequirementDisplay to take
  AdditionalRequirement | null as props and output
  AdditionalRequirement
