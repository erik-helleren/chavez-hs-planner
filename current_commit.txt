Debug infinite loop bug in student-info-display

* add cloneAndMerge to shared/util/clone ct to document intent 
  more clearly when combining objects than Object.assign({}, A, B)
  ** 'clone' no longer default export of shared/util/clone.
    refactor components which use 'clone' to import it correctly
* rewrite change handlers in student-info-display and child
  components to check for changes before cloning input objects
  and calling parent callback with cloned object. It seems that
  the parent understandably thinks the cloned object has changed
  even if the cloned object and the original object are equivalent.
* convert ReportCardContainer to stateless functional component
