Write basic HSList and HSListElement component

-- pass unnecessary props down through component hierarchy from
  hs-display to hs-list-element in order to pass StudentData
  and AdditionalRequirements to individual high schools' selection
  functions. Should consider replacing that data passing stuff
  with redux.
