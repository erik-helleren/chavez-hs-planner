Implement HS Data config

* create data/hs-config-data for containing HSData object
  that app uses to display highschools and requirements
  functions that decide if studetent can apply/be accepted.
* create shared/util/hs-calc-util for containing functions
  that calculate SE and IB scores, etc
* input some HS data into data/hs-config-data, but there's a
  lot more that needs to be done.
* fix display issues in HSList

* TODO IN FUTURE create method or alter existing method to
  project StudentData instead of projecting StudentScores.
  It's confusing to have to manually switch the student's
  grade to 7 in order for the calculator to work properly.

* TODO IN FUTURE to think about -- is hs-config-data ts file
  the easiest way for future peeps to input high school data?
  Probably definitely not, but I think it's premature optimizing
  to worry about that now. I don't know what the easiest way
  for others to input the hs data is, and it may turn out that
  a UI that generates the .ts/.js file is the easiest way of
  doing it. Won't worry about it until it's necessary.
