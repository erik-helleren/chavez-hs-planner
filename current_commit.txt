[WIP] Update build scripts in build.py

* build.py now takes filepath to raw admissions
  program data from cps and writes JSON file
  with all programs, plus added ID, Application_Req_Fn
  and Selection_Req_Fn properties

* refactor scripts in build/
  ** previous build scripts did several things at once and
    wrote directly to filesystem; refactored scripts to
    each do one thing at once, and to take file objects
    as input and return file objects as output.

* README.txt contains instructions for writing app
  config using build.py
=======
Debug app afte changes in requirement functions

* fix tsc compilation errors
  ** add missing properties to hardcoded student data 
      in src/path-to-hs/hardcoded.ts
  ** update StudentData type to make seTestPercentile to make
    seTestPercentile property optional

* TODO remove requirement functions for Academic Centers in
  shared/data/hs_req_fns.ts
  ** NOTE earlier, I had incorrectly assumed Academic Centers
    were Selective Enrollment schools -- so I tried to look up
    their cutoff scores using the getSECutoff() function. This
    errored because Academic Centers are not SE schools.
