[WIP] Wire together app and hs req fns

* move everything out of config/data except hs_req_fns.ts
  and hs_config_data.json
* copy config/data/hs_req_fns.ts and /hs_config_data.json to src/shared/data

* change 'school type' based data expected by app to 'program type' based
  data in new hs_config_data.json
  ** Refactor HSRequirementFunction type
  ** Add types HSPrograms, HSProgram, SuccessChance, SuccessProgress 
  ** Remove types Highschool, HSCategoryData, HSData
  ** New module in shared/util: data-access.ts
    *** exposes loadHSPrograms(): HSPrograms
      **** method reads hs_config_data.json and returns neatly formatted
          HSPrograms

  ** refactor path-to-hs.tsx to use data-access.loadHSPrograms
  ** refactor hs-display.tsx to use HSPrograms instead of HSConfigData
  ** refactor hs-cateogry.tsx to use HSPrograms
    *** rename to hs-program-type.tsx
    *** remove additional requirement code until certain what to do with it
    *** refactor to only display name of program type until we can figure out what
      more to include
  ** refactor hs-list.tsx to not require AddlReqs prop
  ** refactor hs-list-element.tsx to not require AddlReqs prop and accept
    HSProgram not Highschool
    *** comment out iconURL handling code
  ** refactor hs-info-card -> hs-program-info-card
  ** add shared/utils/get-req-fn to cover up hsReqFn hashtable lookup

* TODO IN FUTURE hs_config_data.json appears to have a few programs that aren't
  matched with hs req fns. (How ever did that happen?) Should patch them up manually
  by sticking on the hash value to the records in hs_config_data.json. For right now,
  tho, I'm gonna jet. This was a really good day.
