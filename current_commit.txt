Refactor restrictor in shared form fields

* handle null values in restrictor and field
* convert field input components to controlled
  from uncontrolled
* TODO IN FUTURE consider having each form field
  hold local state, so that restricted values (like
  null values etc) can be entered but do not get 
  passed to parent via onChange.
