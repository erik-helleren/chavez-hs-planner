Refactor StudentDataForm

* convert raw html form fields in student-data-form.tsx 
  into new shared form fields components
* deleted some unused old form field components in
  shared/components/ui
* fix incorrect validation of some form fields
  * fix nwea percentile inputs allowing values <1 and >99
  * fix grade inputs allowing values <0 and >100
* add missing form fields for new properties on StudentData:
  **  gender
  **  attendance percentage
  **  prev school
  **  sibling current school
* update api in data-access.ts to return CPS programs
  grouped by program type only when asked for
  ** updated components which call getHSProgramsByType
  ** fixed bug which prevented proper returning of es programs
* TODO IN FUTURE debounce input from Input components to avoid
  constant validation checks / page updates. We're in a hurry,
  so it'll have to stay messy for now.
