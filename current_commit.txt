Wire together StudentDataForm, StudentInfoContainer, HSDisplay

* DONE fix StudentDataForm subjectGrade fields not displaying grade
  ** subjectGrade fields now display number grade and not letter grade
* DONE add onChange handlers to form fields in StudentDataForm
* DONE update state.projectedStudentData on reciept of changed studentData
  in path-to-hs.tsx

* TODO IN FUTURE leave this heirarchical component state stuff in the dust
  and refactor to redux. Should do this after we can get a recognizable first
  draft of the calculator running.
