Sort HSPrograms in HSGroup by outcome

* rewrite getCombinedSuccessChance to only operate
  on success chances and not silently call requirement
  functions
* edit SuccessChance enum so that higher success
  chances are assigned to higher integers, enabling
  fast and easy comparison of success chances.
  ** NOTE this introduces a tight coupling between HSGroup
    and SuccessChance, but benefits me in that I
    don't need to write arduous code to compare SuccessChances
    when I'm trying to sort by them. It will be worthwhile
    to remember this choice and see if it comes back to bite
    me somehow -- that could be a valuable lesson in what
    the true costs and benefits are of bending the rules
    like this.
