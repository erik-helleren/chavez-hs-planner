Write MultiSelectField component

* use combobox listBox filtering code
* special input fields:
  ** display new ComboBox input for each value in props.values
  ** button to remove each child ComboBox
  ** button to add new ComboBox

* TODO IN FUTURE need to solve one last annoying problem --
  new input does not automatically refresh to empty string
  when user makes selection and new input appears. Not
  completely sure why! Will need to figure it out...
  ** NOTE but I am pretty impressed with myself for figuring
    this out so quickly. Killin' it Michael.
