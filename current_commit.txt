Bugfix: fill nonbreaking spaces when building hs_req_fns.ts

* for some reason, the unicode nbsp character was being inconsistently
  inserted into different programs' selection and application req fn
  descriptions, playing havoc with the hash that links requirement functions.
  (It was bad enough when I thought it was consistent, and some schools
  with the same semantic requirements would have different requirement function
  records because of a typo, but this time it's caused the req_fn_id properties
  of some programs to change after I updated cps_programs.json recently, which
  is super bad.)
