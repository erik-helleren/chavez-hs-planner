[WIP] Update build scripts in build.py

* build.py now takes filepath to raw admissions
  program data from cps and writes JSON file
  with all programs, plus added ID, Application_Req_Fn
  and Selection_Req_Fn properties

* refactor scripts in build/
  ** previous build scripts did several things at once and
    wrote directly to filesystem; refactored scripts to
    each do one thing at once, and to take file objects
    as input and return file objects as output.

* README.txt contains instructions for writing app
  config using build.py
