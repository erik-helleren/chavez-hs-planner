Draft ComboBoxField component

* a lil messy but it works without tight coupling
  to data being passed to it -- on the down side,
  it requires a somewhat complicated data passing
  mechanism that I should look to simplify.
  (Data is passed to combobox as object with three properties:
  records, containing array of all data, getKey,
  containing function taking type record and returning
  a unique string, and getDisplayName, a function
  taking type record and returning the name that
  should be shown for that option. That's the most
  flexible, but ... seems like a lot? In any case,
  it works

* TODO IN FUTURE there's some dead code in shared/ui/fields
