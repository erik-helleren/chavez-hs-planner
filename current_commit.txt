[WIP] Fix hs-program-info-card overflow issue

* issue: HSProgramInfoCard, which drops down on mouseover
  of HSListElement, overflowed past page boundaries
  when it appears

* modify HSDisplay, HSList, HSListElement, and HSProgramInfoCard
  to pass bounding box info of HSList down to HSProgramInfoCard
  ** HSDisplay and HSProgramInfoCard converted to React.PureComponent
    in order to handle bounding box calculations
  ** HSProgramInfoCard calculates its bounding boxe when it is 
    drawn to see if it goes over the lines of the HSList bounding
    box passed down to it; if it does overflow, the component offsets
    itself by that amount via the 'left' and 'top' css declarations
  ** NOTE this passing the bounding boxes down the component tree malarkey
    is another reason why using Redux would be a really good idea

* remove old hasPreviewURL check from HSProgramInfoCard
