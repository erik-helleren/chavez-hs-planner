Refactor HSList to include application requirements

* current system does not take application requirements into
    account when showing success state -- obviously bad
* refactor getReqFn to be of type
    CPSProgram => {application: HSRequirementFunction,
                selection: HSRequirementFunction}
* rename getReqFn -> getReqFns

* refactor HSList and HSListElement to calculate
    success state by this procedure:
    is application req outcome CERTAIN or LIKELY?
      if yes, return selection req outcome
      otherwise, return application req outcome
  ** add getCombinedSuccessChance util function to
    shared/util, import it in HSList and HSListElement
  ** TODO IN FUTURE the code is very messy. Could use
    some rethinking.
* rename HsReqFns -> HSReqFns for consistency with
  rest of codebase
