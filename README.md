# Chavez Highschool Planner

The Chavez Highschool Planner is a web app that helps Chicago Public Schools students plan for high school.

The web app shows students their chances of being accepted to any CPS high school, based on the student's current attendance, grades, and standardized test scores.

The Chavez HS Planner is still under active development, and contributions are encouraged. See the open [issues](https://github.com/mpingram/chavez-hs-planner/issues) for more information.

## Running the web app locally

To run the Chavez HS Planner web app locally (for development), you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Once you've installed Node, navigate to the directory where you've cloned the repository and run

    npm install

This will install the project's dependencies. Then, run

    npm start

to run the server.
